								<p>Conclusions</p>
								<h2>Limitations</h2>
								</header>
								<p>China, due to the size of its population, often has the largest number affected in natural disasters. This may have biased our data, and made largest number affected a less reliable measure of magnitude. We could have put total affected as a percentage value to minimise the impact of this factor. However, it is important to note that despite the relative sizes of countries, the effects of natural disasters should not be minimised simply because of a larger population.</p>

								<p>Some of the disaster events did not include latitude and longitude, so we had to use a unified value for all disasters occured in a particular country, rather than the specific geographical location of individual natural disaster. Indeed, not all natural disasters are confined to a singular location - floods, for example. This leads to the superposition of circles on our maps, making our visualisations less comprehensible. On the scatter plot, this poses a less serious problem because each data point has a unique coordinate. This issue is also mitigated by the detailed data analyses under the visualisations.</p>
								<p>Furthermore, the demographic of Google users may be such that areas with limited internet access are not represented in the data from Google Trends. For instance, China has the great firewall which keeps millions of internet users from a list of websites including Google; as a result, the search interests of those people may not be reflected in our data. This problem also applies to countries with low search volume, which are not included in Google Trends data that we downloaded. These all affect the accuracy of our visualisations to different extents.</p>

								<p>Only using Google Trends also restricts the breadth of our media analysis. In a longer project, it may have been interesting to include other media types: newspapers, television reports and other forms of social media, for example.</p>

								<p>Much of our analysis is based on observation, rather than specific statistical analysis. To include this, we could have extended the range of our data on the scatter plot, and then calculated the r-value of each scatter plot to determine if a genuine relationship exists between natural disaster size and reaction amount. However, based on our visualisations, it can be seen that a strict numerical relationship does not exist between the amount of media attention a disaster receives and the number of people it affects. Therefore, regression analysis might be a redundant component.</p>

								<p>Conclusions</p>
								<h2>Potential impact</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Our conclusions add to the existing literature, and suggest interesting ways to approach natural disasters and media response. This could lead to a number of potential impacts:</p>

							<li>If, as the literature notes, society and technology can help to mediate vulnerabilities, our project shows which countries may be extra vulnerable because of a lack of attention from global media. Delimiting these areas could allow us to aid recovery and to prepare a better media coverage. Charities that work in disaster aid, for example, could optimize the spread of awareness of disasters in these areas to increase success of fundraising appeals.</li>

							<li>While our research showed that the size of an event cannot be said to significantly correlate with media reaction, it does go some way to suggesting other possible factors. With further exploration, this could be used to show what specific factors mean a large media reaction: this could be used in many arenas, and could even be useful beyond natural disasters.</li>

							<li>Our project can also allow us to identify areas that are particularly affected by disasters and that could possibly need more support. They can allow us to identify vulnerable countries that often face disasters.</li>

							<li>Our visualisations show possible existing disparities between countries in terms of reactions. They can represent effectively how people mainly react to the events that occur in their living region, but also to events that occur in specific regions of the world. Some regions are over ‘watched’, some are not enough. The reactions to an event are generally shaped by the media coverage of the topic in question. Therefore, our visualisations are a good means to show how global reactions, and, by association, medias, are often not representative of reality.</li>

							<li>The global visualisations of natural disasters in the world over the years can finally be a precious source of information. If the project were to be extended over a longer period of time, the evolution of natural disasters over time, and especially an increase in their amount, could be revealing of the effects of climate change on the planet. </li>
