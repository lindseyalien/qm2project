											<iframe width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" src="visualisations/reactionsfloodyears.html" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>
										  <p>These maps show, respectively, the number of floods per year per country, and the countries with the largest reaction each year (on a scale of 1-100, with 100 being the largest reaction). In analysing the number of events per year it can be seen that, although a significant number occur sporadically in other regions (for example, America and South America), the majority of flooding events take place in Asia - specifically regions in South Asia, East Asia and South-East Asia. In 3 out of the 10 years analysed, the largest interest in the search term ‘Floods’ was also found in this area. This supports the concept of ‘distance bias’ (Berlemann and Thomas, 2018) - overall, these visualisations show that those who are most affected by, or are close to those affected by, the disaster are the ones who are most likely to react to the event.</p>
											<p>However, often the amount of events and the amount of media interest do not seem to be linked. To take an example, the largest reaction in 2013 came from Western Europe. However, the actual occurrence of flooding in this area was relatively low, especially when compared to the aforementioned regions in Asia. This mismatch may come from a variety of reasons - this analysis does not take into account the size of the event, for example. It may also show that this region has more significant reactions, even in the face of a smaller number of events, suggesting differences in the relative power of reactions across the globe. This may support concepts of Western media bias (The Listening Post, 2015). Indeed, perhaps having a smaller number of disasters in general makes reactions larger because of a ‘shock’ effect. This may suggest how natural disasters such as floods are a ‘normal’ occurrences in some countries (for example, Indonesia), whereas they are ‘freak events’ in others. In these cases of ‘freak events’, risk perception may be much higher, with the event being viewed as far more dangerous (Fothergill & Peek, 2004, as cited in Nix-Stevenson, 2013).</p>
											<h3>Section 2: Analysis of biggest reactions and biggest number of people affected</h3>
											<h1 class="align-center">The Top 5 Actual Occurence</h1>
											<iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://lindseyalien.carto.com/builder/ebbca14d-cbc7-41fc-b1a5-b714809e8e59/embed" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>
											<h1 class="align-center">The Top 5 Reactions</h1>
											<iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://lindseyalien.carto.com/builder/f41b51a1-02dd-4717-92f0-a49cda299051/embed" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>
												<p>From just a glance at the two visualisations - the first showing the largest floods according to people affected and the second showing the floods with the largest media reactions - it can be seen that the two factors are not directly linked. Indeed, many of the floods with the most number of people affected not only warranted a smaller response - but were barely responded to at all.</p>

												<p>A large factor in this lack of response may be internet restrictions in China, with four of the five largest events taking place here. While they were affected the most, their reactions were not documented in our dataset, and they may have been unable to react at all online. However, the overall lack of reaction worldwide also reflects a distance bias (Berlemann and Thomas, 2018). Floods that occur in areas with more access to the internet (specifically Google), have a far larger reaction because those involved are closer, perhaps both in distance and culture, to those who are reacting (Solman and Henderson, 2018; Berlemann and Thomas, 2018) . When looking at Google Trends data in more depth it can even be seen that other floods which were far smaller on our chosen scale, for example those in France in 2010, gained a far larger reaction - almost overshadowing larger events such as those in China. As Moeller (2006), who points out this possibility of “overshadowing”, argues, magnitude in these situations is not necessarily a “solid predictor of coverage”. </p>

												<p>Because of this, it is also interesting to specifically note the geographic locations of those floods which had the largest media response. The four largest flooding events occured in China, with the fifth largest occurring in Pakistan. However, four out of the five biggest reactions occurred in Europe, the USA and Australia - with one taking place in Thailand. This seems to suggest some kind of Western bias, as noted in the literature section. However, when linking this data to the concept of risk perception, it could be argued that a larger global reaction may mean a community is in fact able to prepare for the event more effectively - with greater shared knowledge between country and people. Therefore, this media reaction may itself lead to a reduction in vulnerability: suggesting another explanation for the low numbers of people affected (Dalby, 2013). </p>
												<h1 class="align-center">Scatter plot of number affected by floods against reaction amount</h1>
												<iframe width="100%" height="450" frameborder="0" class="align-center" src="visualisations/scatterfloods.html" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>
												<p>The scatter plots confirm the main message of these visualisations - and are perhaps even more striking. In these scatter plots, the results presented are almost the antithesis of our original hypothesis, and viewed alone would go as far as to suggest a negative correlation: with the largest reactions coming alongside the smallest number of people affected. R-values here - then talk about correlation doesn’t equal causation  While the main maps show other, more realistic, potential explanations (distance bias, Western bias), it is interesting to observe just how far away these two factors are from being directly correlated in the case of floods.</p>
											<h3>Section 3: Conclusions</h3>
										  <p> In conclusion, an analysis of the data taken from floods shows that there is little quantitative proof for a solid link between the size of a flood event, and the amount of media response to this. However, the geographic dispersion of events, and links between number of events and reactions per country, shows evidence that support ideas of distance bias, Western bias and concepts of risk perception and vulnerability to disasters. This gives the potential of other explanations to the extent of media response - beyond the size of the event itself. </p>
