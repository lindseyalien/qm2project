								<p>Project Overview</p>
								<h2>Vision and Motivation</h2>
							</header>
							<p>A common interest in the environment led our group to choose natural disasters as the focus in our project. We felt there was a gap in our knowledge about human reaction to these natural disasters, and felt this would therefore be an interesting subject to approach quantitatively. We decided to collect data of both natural disasters and media reaction to see whether a link exists between them.</p>


							<p>Although we originally sought to evaluate the change in natural disasters over time, as we narrowed down the scope of our project it became unrealistic to collect the huge amount of data that this would require. Climate change is based on a very long timescale, not to mention that our hypotheses would inevitably become very complex. As a result, we decided only to focus on media reaction to natural disasters in the past ten years.</p>


							<p>We chose five of the most common disaster types: volcanoes, storms, wildfires, floods, and earthquakes. This represents a range in disaster types that we assumed would be diversely spread around the world, and would also have a reasonable amount of media attention. By setting the timescale to ten years we provided an acceptable chronological diversity, and we collected data about natural disasters from a global database to provide a geographical diversity.</p>


							<p>To narrow our focus, we paid close attention to the natural disasters that affected the greatest number of people, hypothesising that these large events were more likely to attract media attention from geographically dispersed populations. As we shall see, this assumption is challenged in our data analysis.</p>

									<p>Project Overview</p>
									<h2>Aims and Hypothesis</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Our aim is to explore the connections between disaster events and the media response to them. We will first determine whether there is indeed a global media reaction to natural disasters. Once this is determined, we will move on to an analysis of various factors, examining what contributes to these varied responses. </p>

								<p>Intuitively, we hypothesise that:
								<li>There will be a global media reaction to natural disasters (of significant magnitude)</li>
							 	<li>The amount of media attention should reflect the size of natural disasters</li>
								<li>However, there will also be some connection between socio-cultural factors and media attention</li>
