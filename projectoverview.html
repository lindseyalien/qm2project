								<p>Project Overview</p>
								<h2>Vision and Motivation</h2>
							</header>
							<p>	A common interest in the environment led our group to choose natural disasters as the focus in our project. We felt there was a gap in our knowledge about human reaction to these natural disasters, and felt this would therefore be an interesting subject to approach quantitatively. In researching this question, data of natural disasters does not have meaning by itself; it is only possible to discover patterns when they are analysed in conjunction with human response or interpretation. Therefore, we decided to collect data of both natural disasters and media reaction to see whether a link exists between them.</p>
							<p>Although we originally sought to evaluate the change in natural disasters over time, as we narrowed down the scope of our project it became unrealistic to collect the huge amount of data that this would require. Climate change is based on a very long timescale, not to mention that our hypotheses would inevitably become very complex. As a result, we decided only to focus on media coverage of natural disasters in the past ten years. </p>
   					  <p> We chose five of the most common disaster types: volcanoes, storms, wildfires, floods, and earthquakes.This represented a range in disaster types that we assumed would be diversely spread around the world, and would also has a reasonable amount of media coverage. By setting the timescale to ten years we provided an acceptable chronological diversity, and we collected data about natural disasters from a global database to provide a geographical diversity. </p>
							<p> To narrow our focus, we paid close attention to the natural disasters that affected the greatest number of people, hypothesising that these large events were more likely to attract media attention from geographically dispersed populations. As we shall see, this assumption is challenged in our data analysis.</p>

									<h2>Aims and Hypothesis</h2>
								</header>
								<p>In this project we aim to confirm or disprove our hypotheses through global geographical comparisons of natural disasters and media responses. We first determine if there exists a global media reaction to natural disasters. We then plot our data on a scatter graph to see whether a correlation exists between media coverage and natural disasters; and if so, how does the correlation stand.</p>
								<p>We have seen that media coverage is linked with multiple factors. Intuitively, we assume that media coverage would reflect the size of natural disasters. We also hypothesize that there will be a certain form of connection between social-cultural factors and media coverage, but we cannot specify what this will be before we analyse our data visualisation.</p>
