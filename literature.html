							<p>There are many possible explanations to this media bias. Research indicates that there are multiple factors contributing to media coverage: including ownership of media companies, geographical proximity, economic development of the countries, and the way in which victims are represented (Center For Media, Data and Society, 2018). One factor that has been particularly noted is that of distance bias, or the remoteness of the event to those reporting (Berlemann and Thomas, 2018). Some go as far as to suggest that it is a cultural, rather than geographical connection, that leads to increased interest in a disaster event (Solman and Henderson, 2018). Further to this, media attention can be shifted by other events happening at the same time, ‘overshadowing’ the other, and can even be altered based on the availability of images to be used on media outlets (Moeller, 2006). Indeed, media coverage may be even less systemic than this, with Moeller (2006) calling it a “humanitarian sweepstakes” of which disasters get attention and which do not.</p>

							<p> However, has been noted that media bias has often been such that disasters in the Western world attract significantly more attention (The Listening Post, 2015). For instance, Facebook was accused of the prioritization of some lives over others after it activated its Safety Check, a tool that allows users to inform friends of their safety, in the aftermath of the Paris Attack, yet not for other recent attacks such as the one in Beirut (D'Orazio, 2015). In one case study it is highlighted that British newspapers devoted more internet space to the northern England flood, whereas the reports about floods in Chennai, India were much more removed and dispassionate (Solman & Henderson, 2018). This focus shows a Western bias in media reporting. Indeed, even non-Western countries where Western people are involved in the disaster (for example, Indonesia) are reported more heavily (Moeller, 2006). Western media seems to give their attention to their “own” (Moeller, 2006), with this, disproportionately, representing the dominant global media.</p>

							<p>“Number of threatened or killed is not a solid predictor of coverage”. It is clearly not only the actual intensity of these disasters that determines the scale of reporting or media coverage (Franks, 2006, as cited in Solman & Henderson, 2018). Our investigation will explore whether these factors noted in the literature relate to natural disasters on a global scale.</p>

							<p>Another aspect of media coverage that might be important to interpreting the results for our data science project is the difference in individuals’ risk perception. It has been highlighted that vulnerability to natural disasters is in part defined by a person’s or group's ability to anticipate, resist, and recover from the impact of the natural disasters (Fothergill & Peek, 2004, as cited in Nix-Stevenson, 2013). Nevertheless, determinants that make people vulnerable are rarely tackled by academic literature (Cannon, as cited in Haque and Etkin, 2007). Nix-Stevenson’s (2013) article emphasizes the point that “people of color and poor people in the United States, U.S.-occupied territories, and around the world are disproportionately and differentially vulnerable because of preexisting systems of stratification” (p.1). Write about dalby These observations are crucial in the analysis of our data visualization, and in exploring the possibility that the size of media response may similarly make people more or less vulnerable in the face of natural disasters.</p>
